## My process

- Started with html elements and creating the sections to group things together such as the user's img, name, location, and description for one section and the buttons for the second section.
- Once all the elements were placed, started on sizing in CSS. Started with the main profile card's size and let everything else's size be based off of that.
- Added the fonts and colors from the style guide into variables so that it would be easy to change and customize for someone else later on.
- Lastly, worked on placement (my current weakness). Used some math to calculate how far down I wanted the profile card to go on the page. Ideally, I would used flexbox or used position: absolute, but I wanted to try to use what I've learned so far without using things I don't fully understand yet.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties

### What I learned

- Placement is still an issue for me, so I need to do some more review on that. 
- Learned how to make a button into a link. Alternatively I could have used a div and style it to look the same? But this was my first time using button so I really wanted to try it. It come out pretty well, I think.
- Reviewed hover effects. I really like them and would like to practice using them more often and in different ways.

### Useful resources

- [Dimensions Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/dimensions/baocaagndhipibgklemoalmkljaimfdj) - This extension was really helpful in making sure that my profile card was actually centered. I can never really tell when something is centered, so using this has been extremely helpful.
